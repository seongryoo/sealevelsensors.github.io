The Smart Sea Level Sensors team had their fourth workshop at the Coastal Georgia Center on January 29, 2019, which included a day of meetings with stakeholders on January 28 to grow the project's network of partners and collaborators.

On January 28, members of the Smart Sea Level Sensors team met with several stakeholders to build on existing partnerships and define new areas of collaboration
* **Grace Herrington and Tom Maty, [Jenkins High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_High_School).** The team kicked off a hands-on STEM project with Jenkins students to assemble sea level sensors to be deployed around Chatham County. Students will also suggest design modifications and improvements for future types of sensors.
* **Rebecca Greenbush, [Oglethorpe Charter School](http://www.oglethorpecharter.org/).** The team charted out next steps to pilot a curriculum on sea level rise in a 6th grade science class in late Spring 2019.
* **Beth Palmer, [Tybee Island Marine Science Center](https://www.tybeemarinescience.org/).** The team discussed plans for an educational installation of a sea level sensor at the Tybee Beach Pier, as well as an exhibit at the Tybee Island Marine Science Center's new facility.
* **Carl Lewis, [Open Savannah](https://opensavannah.org/).** The team discussed how to make data recorded by sensors more accessible and useful to community members, and made plans for a data jam event later in the spring to encourage creative, novel and insightful of sensor data.
* **Dr. Mildred McClain, [Harambee House](https://www.theharambeehouse.net/).** The team spoke about how to reach vulnerable communities in Savannah to enable more effective emergency planning and response.

On January 29, the Smart Sea Level Sensors team held a workshop to update stakeholders about progress made since October and upcoming plans. Dr. Russ Clark presented additional sensor deployments and announced a new API to access data recorded by sensors. Dr. Emanuele Di Lorenzo shared updated results from a high-resolution coastal ocean model. Lalith Polepeddi presented work done by Georgia Tech undergraduate computer science students to create web and mobile apps to visualize sensor data. The workshop was covered by the [Savannah Morning News](https://www.savannahnow.com/news/20190130/chatham-county-sea-level-sensor-project-seeks-input).

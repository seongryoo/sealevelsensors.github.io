The workshop was attended by Greg McCormick, Director of the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge, who helped with planning year 2 of the Smart Sea Level Sensors project. The workshop was also attended by Carl Lewis from [Open Savannah](https://opensavannah.org/), who presented a proposal to build tools and services on top of the [Sea Level Sensors API](https://dev.sealevelsensors.org/) to make sensor data useful for Chatham County residents. 

The next event for the Smart Sea Level Sensors team is scheduled for May 16 in Savannah to mark the first year of the project.

This internship opportunity is in collaboration with the Global Change Program (GCP), the Center for Career Discovery &amp; Development (C2D2), and the Student Government Association (SGA).</p> 

          <p>Our internships have generously been funded and supported by our Serve-Learn-Sustain (SLS) partner at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p> 

          <p>The Smart Sea Level Sensor internship will provide real-life experience to our interns to learn about climate change challenges and develop ideas on how to mitigate them.</p>

  This summer Kaylyn will be working on the Air Quality Sensors project, an extension of the GT-Chatham County collaboration.  As the project intern, she will aid with air quality sensor data analyzation from the Hudson Hill site and other underserved neighborhood in Savannah. Additionally, she will help develop air pollution mitigation plans based on research findings to reduce air pollution and improve air quality.

  Kaylyn is excited to bring her previous experience working with data acquisition &amp; analysis at Boeing to our internship program. We are looking forward to having her support for our Chatham community partners. She will be teleworking due to COVID-19 social distancing.  We welcome Kaylyn onboard and are very happy to have her on our Smart Sea Level Sensor project team.
